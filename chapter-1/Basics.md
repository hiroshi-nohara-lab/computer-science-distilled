This chapter is just a toolbox for problem solving.
Computers need us to break down problems into chunks they can crunch. To do this we need some math.

You'll learn to:
- Model ideas into flowcharts and pseudocode.
- Know right from the wrong with the logic.
- Count stuff.
- Calculate probabilities safely.

All of the above should still be good to translate your ideas into computable solutions.


### 1.1 Ideas

- Break down problems into manageable chunks.
- Use math to solve problems.
- Model ideas into flowcharts and pseudocode.
- Differentiate between right and wrong using logic.
- Count and calculate probabilities accurately.
